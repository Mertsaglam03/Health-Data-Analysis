          <p class="graph-description">As you can see here It is an highly diverse graph however it does have an certain pattern. In the begining of the year It starts high then it dips to the lowest point and then it rises to its highest point and then it drops yet again. This pattern is usually the semester holiday then spring term after that summer vacation . </p>

We also notice smething strange in spring months the top 5 lowest consists all of them which is starnge because in terms of weather it is one of the best times to go out.</p>

          <p class="graph-description">If you play around with this heatmap for some time you are going to recognise that the month of August has the darkest palette of blue with July and months like may and april having the lightest which just proves my point above. Also the thing that is interesting is that the some months in the spring are lighter than some months in winter. Logically this does not make sense because spring are the times where the weather is the most optimal for being active physcially. </p>

There are also a few exception where I was above it as well you can see by the dot in the graph. And the graph extends on the upper quartile so there is more distribution there due to it having more x values and the line being longer than lowe quartile line. </p>

          <p class="graph-description">We couldn't get much of an result previously so lets try again with an different graph. This time the values peak during the spring time which would mean that during schooltime I use my headphones way more than I supposed for an healhty individual. But my null hypothesis is proved for my headphone data because we could not find an more convincing correlation betwwen them.</p>

          <p class="graph-description">As we can see from the highest generally occur during summer and the frequency of lowest is highest during spring indicating that spring is time where my activeness is at its lowest. We can also expect this result because of the way we analyzed our stepcount and we all know that step count highly corrrelated with calories burned. So, We can confirm our Null Hypothesis based on these visiualizations.</p>

          <p class="graph-description">The dataframe is fairly simple. I have added my calories data and my stepcount data together with my months and days. Also with the helpof my months and days I identified the school days and marked the days I do not have school as 1.</p>

            <p class="graph-title">Logistic Regression</p>
            <p class="graph-description">In order make an decisive analysis of the data. I made an logistic regression for school days because the values were either 1 or 0. As we can see from the graph the places where step count is over 10000 is generally classified as non school days so it is proving my point. The values where both calories burned and step count high are not school days however days where my calories burned is high and stepcount is low are school days. </p>

            <p class="graph-title">Correlations</p>
            <p class="graph-description">In the correlations heatmap we see these results again. School is highly correlated with the amount of steps I take in a day. We see here again that I am more active during non school days. Also I wanted to put months and days here just to see how they effect my step count. They are both positively correlated especially month but not that highly correlated and result with calories burned is expected because the more you burn calories means that you walked more.</p>

            <p class="graph-title">Confusion Matrix</p>
            <p class="graph-description">I wanted to see which days are confused with which and it seems that non school days are confused with school days the most and school days are nearly never confused with non school days which is really interesting.</p>

            <p class="graph-title">The Decision Tree</p>
            <p class="graph-description">Now lets see how the decision tree interperets this data. First of all in the first split We can see that it classifies step counts less than 12k as school days and rest as non school days. In the right it classifies calories less than 295 are all school days so the branching stops and it classfies the rest as non school days. The main pattern that follows in this tree is that when we are working with high calories burned and high step count it always classifies it as non school days and the rest as school days. So, we can conclude it directly proves my point.</p>
