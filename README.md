For our term project this semester We had to analyze our own data using data science. This repository is created for this purpose. In CS210Project.ipynb you can find the codes for the data science part. In myML.ipynb you can find the code for the ML model. The main JavaScript file is app.js and it contains the JavaScript used in the navigation bars and for the second graph in the website you have to wait 10 seconds in order to see the rest of the graphs. It goes year by year and it changes with 10 second increments.

This is CS210 Introduction to Data Science Term Project where.

- I designed my UI from scratch.
- Analyzed my own data using many different data science approaches.
- Trained an ML model that predicts whether a day is an school day or not based on some parameters.
- ✨Magic ✨

## Tech

This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [HTML] - For the UI structure
- [CSS] - For the UI design.
- [JavaScript] - To make the website responsive with great user experience. 
- [Python] - To analyze, visualize the data and train the ML model.
